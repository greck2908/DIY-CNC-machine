License from Ivan's instructions:
Everything that is in these files that I produced myself, 
apart from reselling the files, is allowed. You can print 
and sell parts, sell machines, sell courses to build the 
machine. Modify the parts and post them for free, as long 
as you don’t sell the files and keep this license on everything 
you make with the files and credit me, we’re good. No DRM or 
anything, you are even allowed to repost the files as long as 
they’re kept free. Why buy this then? To support me and keep 
me encouraged to do more projects like this.
